## About CampusKid

CampusKid is a web application designed to make teachers and students
learn better through interactive, real-time and secure services. Such as conducting classes to open discussions as well as tasking with homeworks and many more.

CampusKid is currently being developed with the following features:

-   3-role user system (Administrator, Faculty, Student)
-   Classroom Implementation (Posts, Tasks, Grades, etc)
-   Grading System
-   File Sharing System (For tasks, homeworks, etc)
-   Departments
-   Occupation (For admins and faculties. Ex: Dean, Professor, Part-time Instructor, etc)
-   Subjects
-   And many more..

Features are being implemented slowly as to make sure that there will be no conflicts
with what is currently available. The project is pretty new so there is not much
on the front-end yet. But most of the backend is complete except for
the grading system and file sharing system.
